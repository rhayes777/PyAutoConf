"""
Generic CSV reader/writer helpers for the PyAuto ecosystem.

Sits alongside :mod:`autoconf.dictable` (JSON) and :mod:`autoconf.fitsable`
(FITS) as the third text-format I/O surface. The functions here are schema
agnostic — callers layer their own column conventions on top (see e.g.
``autolens.point.dataset`` for the PointDataset schema layer).

Only the standard-library ``csv`` module is used; there is no pandas
dependency.

    Write ``rows`` to ``file_path`` as a CSV.

    Parameters
    ----------
    rows
        Either a list of dicts (``{column: value}``) or a list of sequences.
    file_path
        Destination path. Parent directories are created if missing.
    headers
        Optional explicit column list.

        - For dict rows with ``headers=None``: the header row is the union
          of keys across all rows in first-appearance order — a column is
          written if *any* row populates it, and rows that omit the key
          get a blank cell.
        - For dict rows with explicit ``headers``: the given columns are
          used verbatim; extra keys in any row are dropped silently; missing
          keys produce blanks.
        - For sequence rows: ``headers`` is required.

    Read a CSV and return its rows as an ordered list of dicts.

    Row order is preserved.  Within each row, keys are ordered to match the
    header line (Python dicts are insertion-ordered and :class:`csv.DictReader`
    inserts fields in ``fieldnames`` order), so callers that need the header
    list can recover it with ``list(rows[0].keys())`` when at least one row
    is present.

    An empty CSV (no header line) and a header-only CSV (header line but no
    data rows) both return an empty list.
